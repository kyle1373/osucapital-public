# osu! capital frontend

osu! capital's frontend uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory with the same fields as `.env-example`. Fill the `.env` with those fields.

Then, install the dependencies.

`yarn` or `npm i`

Run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/`. The page auto-updates as you edit the files. Each file corresponds to a page.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
